## Blender

Blender is a free software for 3D graphics.  

The different files in this folder can be integrated into different simulators like Gazebo, Gazebo Ignition, Unity and many others. By opening it in Blender, you can modify them as you wish or export them in the 3D format that suits you best.  
  
<br/>

**Types of models**:  
- Fluids dynamics
- Particle dynamics
- Soft body dynamics

<br/>

**List of models**:  
- Ground
- Each object

<br/>
<br/>

## Collada
(COLLAborative Design Activity) is a format for 3D object.  

The different files in this folder allow you to integrate each shape as a model in a simulator like Gazebo, Gazebo Ignition or other.  
These files were created with the Blender software by exporting its file as a 3D object in Collada format, that is to say with the extension dae.
